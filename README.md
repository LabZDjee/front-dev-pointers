# Links and Pointers for Front-end Dev

Handy common place to put stuff usually needed when developing in HTML/javascript/CSS, etc

## Technical details

*vue.js* is used to facilitate definition of URL's through a *vue component* which includes repeated information and alleviates the ```<a href...>``` syntax

Component usage syntax:

 - ```<url th="description: url" li="true|false"></url>```

so, the ```th``` parameter contains description text and URL (separated by a column and a space) and the ```li``` paramter tells wheter the ```<a>``` link should be surrounded by ```<li>``` markup
